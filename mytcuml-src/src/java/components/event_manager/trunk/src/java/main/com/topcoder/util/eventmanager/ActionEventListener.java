/**
 * This interface specifies the contract for implementation of an action event listener. It represents the listener
 * notified by the event manager about action events and about the undo/redone events. It provides a method to be
 * invoked about the execution of an action, using the action event and the validation result. It will also provide
 * two methods to be used when an undo/redone event occurred. These methods will be invoked for each undoable action
 * that is undone/redone.

 * The implementation of this interface is typically thread-safe.
