/**
 * <p>
 * This class adapts a TransientAction, to be used as a non-significant UndoableAction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Its purpose is to allow the TransientAction to be used inside a CompoundUndoableAction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class follows the Adapter pattern.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example of usage: the cut undoable action is composed by a transient copy action and an undoable remove action.
 * In order to be able to create a single undoable action for the cut action, and avoid creating a new class, the
 * action will be a compound undoable action, containing the non-significant undoable copy action and the undoable
 * remove action.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Thread-Safety: This class has mutable instance members and no synchronized access is made to these and hence
 * the class is not thread-safe. Also it provides methods for executing the TransientAction it is adapting and
 * the TransientAction might not be thread-safe.
 * </p>
