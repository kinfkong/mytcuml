 * <p>
 * This class is the main class of the component and is responsible for executing all types

 *
 * <p>
 * In this class, The following methods are provided:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Execute Action</li>
 * <li>To redo / undo Actions that exist in the undo / redo manager</li>
 * <li>To query about the Actions to be undone / redone</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Thread-Safety: This class has immutable instance members but is not thread-safe as it provides methods for
 * executing the Action and also methods for undo and redo of UndoableAction and the implementations of the
 * Actions and the UndoableAction interface might or might not be thread-safe and since this class invokes
 * methods of these interfaces, cannot be attributed to be thread-safe.

     * In this class, it provides additional methods which are required for servicing the functional requirements
     * required by the ActionManager like fetching the List of UndoableAction(s) that can be un-done/re-done, the
     * last UndoableAction that can be un-done/re-done and the methods that allow un-doing/re-doing all the
     * UndoableAction(s) it maintains till/including the passed UndoableAction.

     * Thread-Safety: This class has no members of its own but accesses the members from the super class and allows the
     * undo/redo operations of the UndoableAction and these operations are not as such required to be thread-safe and
     * hence this class is not thread-safe.
