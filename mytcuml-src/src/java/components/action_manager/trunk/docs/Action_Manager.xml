<!-- 

This is the configuration file for this component and defines the set of configuration properties for the component.
These configuration properties define the information like maximum number of UndoableAction(s) that should be 
maintained in the UndoManager [AdvancedUndoManager] instance for performing the Undo-Redo operations, and once the
limit is crossed, the UndoManager will flush out the old entries to maintain the size of the entries in the UndoManager.
It also contains the configuration properties that define the instance name of the Log to be used for performing the logging 
using the Logging Wrapper 1.2 component.

Note: This is a sample configuration file. It does not contain valid configuration data and cannot be 
used for testing. It's purpose is to be used as a reference for writing other config files.
