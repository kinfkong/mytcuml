 * This interface lays the contract for handling tabbed pane events (addition/removal of tabs). This is a handler -
 * and not just a passive listener - since it can prevent the closure of tabs. There are three events which can be
 * observed - the addition of a tab, the event just before the closing of tabs (which can be handled to prevent the
 * closure) and the event just after closing of tabs. We extend EventListener to allow easy usage of this handler
 * interface inside Swing components.
