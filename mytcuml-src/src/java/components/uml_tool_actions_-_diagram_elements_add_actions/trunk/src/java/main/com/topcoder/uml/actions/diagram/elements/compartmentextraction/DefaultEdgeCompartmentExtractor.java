/**
 * <p>
 * This class extends AbstractCompartmentExtractor class and so implements CompartmentExtractor interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible to extract and update from the given GraphEdge the following compartments:
 * <ul type="disc">
 * <li>name</li>
 * <li>stereotype</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class can be used for GraphEdge that follows the structure:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * Uml1SemanticModelBridge.element = &lt;UML:xxx&gt;
 *     SimpleSemanticModelElement.typeInfo = &quot;StereotypeCompartment&quot;
 *     SimpleSemanticModelElement.typeInfo = &quot;Name&quot;
 * </pre>
 * Such structure corresponds to the following type:
 * <ul type="disc">
 * <li>Include</li>
 * <li>Extend</li>
 * <li>Transition</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note, the order of the first and the second SemanticModelElement does not matter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety : This class is not thread safe as element is mutable, in addition it depends
 * on the thread safety of implementation of diagram interchange component.
 * </p>
