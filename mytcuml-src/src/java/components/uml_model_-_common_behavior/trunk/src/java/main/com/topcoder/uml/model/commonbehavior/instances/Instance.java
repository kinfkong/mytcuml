/**
 * <p>This interface extends ModelElement interface. The ModelElement interface comes form the Core
 * Requirements component. The instance construct defines an entity to which a set of operations
 * can be applied and which has a state that stores the effects of the operations. In the metamodel,
 * Instance is connected to at least one Classifier that declares its structure and behavior. It
 * has a set of attribute values and is connected to a set of Links, both sets matching the
 * definitions of its Classifiers. The two sets implement the current state of the Instance. An
 * Instance may also own other Instances or Links.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety</strong></p>
 * <p>Implementations do not have to be thread-safe. In fact, method synchronization is discouraged.
 * Thread safety will be provided by the application using these implementations.</p>
