/**
 * <p>
 * A transition is a progression (or a moving from) from one state to another and is triggered by an event that is
 * either internal or external to the entity being modeled. For a class, transitions are typically the result of the
 * invocation of an operation that causes an important change in state, although it is important to understand that not
 * all method invocations will result in transitions. An action is something, in the case of a class it is an operation,
 * that is invoked by/on the entity being modeled.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A transition is a directed relationship between a source vertex and a target vertex. It may be part of a compound
 * transition, which takes the state machine from one state configuration to another, representing the complete response
 * of the state machine to an occurrence of an event of a particular type.(OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification -
 * UML 2.0 Superstructure Specification, p. 624)
