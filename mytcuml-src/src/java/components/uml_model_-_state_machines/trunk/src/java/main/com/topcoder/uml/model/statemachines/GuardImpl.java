/**
 * <p>
 * A guard is a condition that must be true in order to traverse a transition. It prevents the transition being taken
 * unless the condition evaluates to true. To expand on this concept: A guard is a boolean expression that is attached
 * to a transition as a fine-grained control over its firing. NOTE: Guards Should Not Overlap. The guards on similar
 * transitions leaving a state must be consistent with one another. For example guards such as [x &lt;0], [x = 0], and
 * [x &gt; 0] are consistent whereas guard such as [x &lt;= 0] and [x &gt;= 0] are not consistent because they overlap.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety</b>: This implementation is mutable and has not been thread-safe as this is not required/desirable.
