 * Pseudostate are choice vertices which, when reached, result in the dynamic evaluation of the guards of the triggers
 * of its outgoing transitions. This realizes a dynamic conditional branch. It allows splitting of transitions into
 * multiple outgoing paths such that the decision on which path to take may be a function of the results of prior
 * actions performed in the same run-to-completion step.(OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification - UML 2.0
 * Superstructure Specification, p. 592)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another quick way of defining it would be to state that it is a vertex in a state machine that has the form of a
 * state, but doesn't behave as a state.
