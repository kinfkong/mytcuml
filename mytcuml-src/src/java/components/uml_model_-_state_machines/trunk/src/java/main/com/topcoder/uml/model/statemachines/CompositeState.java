 * A composite state is decomposed into two or more concurrent substates (called regions) or into mutually exclusive
 * disjoint substates (i.e. sequential). A given state may only be refined in one of these two ways. Naturally, any
 * substate of a composite state can also be a composite state of either type. (OMG Unified Modeling Language
 * Specification - UML 1.5 UML Notation, p. 540)

 * <p>
 * A composite state is a state that contains other state vertices (states, pseudostates, etc.). The association between
 * the composite and the contained vertices is a composition association. Hence, a state vertex can be a part of at most
 * one composite state.
