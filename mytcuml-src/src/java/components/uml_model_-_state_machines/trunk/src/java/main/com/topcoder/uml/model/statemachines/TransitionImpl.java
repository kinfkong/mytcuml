/**
 * <p>A transition is a progression (or a moving from) from one state to another and is triggered by an event that
 * is either internal or external to the entity being modeled. For a class, transitions are typically the result of
 * the invocation of an operation that causes an important change in state, although it is important to understand
 * that not all method invocations will result in transitions.</p>
 *  <p>An action is something, in the case of a class it is an operation, that is invoked by/on the entity being
 * modeled. A transition is a directed relationship between a source vertex and a target vertex. It may be part of a
 * compound transition, which takes the state machine from one state configuration to another, representing the
 * complete response of the state machine to an occurrence of an event of a particular type.(OMG Unified Modeling
 * Language Specification - UML 2.0 Superstructure Specification, p. 624)</p>
 *  <p><b>Thread Safety</b>: Implementation is mutable, and since there is no requirement to make implementations
 * thread-safety this is NOT thread-safe.</p>
