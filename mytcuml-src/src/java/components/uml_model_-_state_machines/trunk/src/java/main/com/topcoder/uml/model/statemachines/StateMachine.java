/**
 * <p>
 * A State Machine models the behaviour of a single object, specifying the sequence of events that an object goes
 * through during its lifetime in response to events. It is a specification that describes all possible behaviors of
 * some dynamic model element (i.e. object). Behavior is modeled as a traversal of a graph of state nodes interconnected
 * by one or more joined transitions (i.e. transition arcs) that are triggered by the dispatching of series of event
 * instances. During this traversal, the state machine executes a series of actions associated with various elements of
 * the state machine. StateMachine contains a top State, which represents the top-level state, and a set of transitions.
 * This means that a state machine owns its transitions and its top state. All remaining states are transitively owned
 * through the state containment hierarchy rooted in the top state (i.e. top state is like a root in a graph) The
 * association to ModelElement provides the context of the state machine. A common case of the context relation is where
 * a state machine is used to specify the life cycle of a classifier.
