/**
 * <p>
 * This is an implementation of the CompositeState Interface which is an extension old State which is in turn an
 * extension of a StateVertes. A composite state is decomposed into two or more concurrent substates (called regions) or
 * into mutually exclusive disjoint substates (i.e. sequential). A given state may only be refined in one of these two
 * ways. Naturally, any substate of a composite state can also be a composite state of either type. (OMG Unified
 * Modeling Language Specification - UML 1.5 UML Notation, p. 540) A composite state is a state that contains other
 * state vertices (states, pseudostates, etc.). The association between the composite and the contained vertices is a
 * composition association. Hence, a state vertex can be a part of at most one composite state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety</b>:This Implementation is mutable and is thus NOT thread-safe. There is no requirement to make
 * implementations of CompositeState interface thread-safe.
