/**
 * <p>
 * A StateVertex is an abstraction of a node in a state chart (state machine) graph. In general, it can be the source or
 * destination of any number of transitions. All types of states in a state machine are children of StateVertex.
 * Currently we have the following types of vertexes:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Pseudostate </li>
 * <li> State </li>
 * <li> FinalState </li>
 * <li> SimpleState </li>
 * <li> CompositeState</li>
 * </ul>
 * (recursive since a StateVertex aggregates a CompositeState as well)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety</b>: This Implementation is mutable, and is not thread-safe. There is no requirement to make any
 * implementation of StateVertex thread-safe.
