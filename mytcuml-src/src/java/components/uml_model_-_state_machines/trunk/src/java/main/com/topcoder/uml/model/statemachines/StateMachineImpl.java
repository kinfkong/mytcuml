/**
 * <p>
 * Imlementation of the stateMachine interface. A State Machine models the behaviour of a single object, specifying the
 * sequence of events that an object goes through during its lifetime in response to events. It is a specification that
 * describes all possible behaviors of some dynamic model element (i.e. object). Behavior is modeled as a traversal of a
 * graph of state nodes interconnected by one or more joined transitions (i.e. transition arcs) that are triggered by
 * the dispatching of series of event instances. During this traversal, the state machine executes a series of actions
 * associated with various elements of the state machine. StateMachine contains a top State, which represents the
 * top-level state, and a set of transitions. This means that a state machine owns its transitions and its top state.
 * All remaining states are transitively owned through the state containment hierarchy rooted in the top state (i.e. top
 * state is like a root in a graph) The association to ModelElement provides the context of the state machine. A common
 * case of the context relation is where a state machine is used to specify the life cycle of a classifier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety</b>: This implementation is mutable, and since there is no requirement to make implementations of
 * Statemachine interface thread-safe, this implementation is NOT thread-safe.
 * </p>
