 * This is the default implementation of the Generalization interface. A generalization is a taxonomic relationship
 * between a more general element and a more specific element. The more specific element is fully consistent with the
 * more general element (it has all of its properties, members, and relationships) and may contain additional
 * information. This class also extends RelationshipAbstractImpl to reuse the code that exists in the abstract class.
 * This class has several simple attributes(discriminator,child, parent, powertype) that describe a generalization.
 * For these simple attributes setters and getters are provided. This class is mutable and not thread safe.
 * Since it is a data class it doesn't really makes sense to make it thread safe.
