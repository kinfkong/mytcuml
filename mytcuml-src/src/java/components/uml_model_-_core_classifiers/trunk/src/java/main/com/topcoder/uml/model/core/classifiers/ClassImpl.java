/**
 * <p>This is a simple concrete implementation of Class interface and extends ClassifierAbstractImpl
 * from the Core Requirements component. A class is a description of a set of objects that share the same
 * attributes, operations, methods, relationships, and semantics. A class may use a set of
 * interfaces to specify collections of operations it provides to its environment. In the
 * metamodel, a Class describes a set of Objects sharing a collection of Features, including
 * Operations, Attributes, and Methods that are common to the set of Objects. Furthermore, a
 * Class may realize zero or more Interfaces; this means that its full descriptor must contain
 * every Operation from every realized Interface (it may contain additional operations as well).</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety</strong></p>
 * <p>This class is mutable and not thread-safe.</p>
