 * <p>This interface extends Classifier interface. The Classifier interface comes form the Core
 * Requirements component. An interface is a named set of operations that characterize the behavior
 * of an element. In the metamodel, an Interface contains a set of Operations that together
 * define a service offered by a Classifier realizing the Interface. A Classifier may offer
 * several services, which means that it may realize several Interfaces, and several Classifiers
 * may realize the same Interface.</p>
