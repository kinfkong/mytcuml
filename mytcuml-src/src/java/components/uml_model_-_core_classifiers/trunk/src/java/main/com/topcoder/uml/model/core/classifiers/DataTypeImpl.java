/**
 * <p>This is a simple concrete implementation of DataType interface and extends ClassifierAbstractImpl
 * from the Core Requirements component. A data type is a type whose values have no identity (i.e., they are
 * pure values). Data types include primitive built-in types (such as integer and string) as
 * well as definable enumeration types (such as the predefined enumeration type boolean whose
 * literals are false and true). In the metamodel, a DataType defines a special kind of
 * Classifier in which Operations are all pure functions (i.e., they can return DataValues
 * but they cannot change DataValues, because they have no identity). For example, an ?add?
 * operation on a number with another number as an argument yields a third number as a result;
 * the target and argument are unchanged.</p>
