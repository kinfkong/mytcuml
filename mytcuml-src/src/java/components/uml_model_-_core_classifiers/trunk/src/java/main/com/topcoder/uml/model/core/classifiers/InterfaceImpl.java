 * <p>This is a simple concrete implementation of Interface interface and extends ClassifierAbstractImpl

 * of an element. In the metamodel, an Interface contains a set of Operations that together
 * define a service offered by a Classifier realizing the Interface. A Classifier may offer
 * several services, which means that it may realize several Interfaces, and several Classifiers
 * may realize the same Interface.</p>
