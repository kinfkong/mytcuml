 * This interface is the primary point of interaction for users of this component.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It lays the contract for a multi-tabbed document tree panel.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The contract consists of methods to add new panels, remove existing ones, and set the current panel.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface also acts as a facade for the other parts of this component and has methods for
 * manipulating the document tree in the current tab.
 * It also has methods to be notified of model changes.
 * Lastly, it also supports addition and removal of event listeners which listen to selection and name
 * change events in the document tree.
