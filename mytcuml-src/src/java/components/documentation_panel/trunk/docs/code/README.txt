This is provided as a usable demo of the Documentation using default editors.
While this is not a complete development solution (dependancies were not set up) it is

To run, either:
1) call 'make', which cleans the folder, compiles the java, and runs the driver class, or:
2) execute:
rm *.class
javac *.java
java PanelDriver
