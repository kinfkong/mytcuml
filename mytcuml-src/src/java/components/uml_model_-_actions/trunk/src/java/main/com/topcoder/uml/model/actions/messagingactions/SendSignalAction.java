/**
 * <p>
 * This interface represents the action that creates a request signal that is transmitted to the target object.
 * The signal may cause the firing of a state machine transition and the execution of an
 * attached procedure. The argument values are available to the execution of attached procedures.
 * After the signal is sent, the requester continues execution without waiting for the request
 * to be delivered or handled. Any attempt by the state machine to issue a reply is ignored.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface extends <code>ExplicitInvocationAction</code> interface.
 * Currently there is one implementation - <code>SendSignalActionImpl</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety</strong>: Implementations of this interface do not have to be thread-safe.
 * In fact, method synchronization is discouraged.
 * Thread safety will be provided by the application using these implementations.
