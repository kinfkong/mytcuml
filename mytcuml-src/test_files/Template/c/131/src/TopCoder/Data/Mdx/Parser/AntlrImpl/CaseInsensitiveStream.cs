/// This class provides case-insensitive lookup capabilities to MdxLexer. This is ANTLR-recommended approach to implementing case-insensitive keywords in grammars.
/// This class overrides the LA(i) method used for lookup of the next character. The overriding version converts characters to lower case before returning them to the lookup service of the lexer. Since all keyword tokens are defined as lower-case strings in the grammar, the lookahead is going to succeed regardless of the case of characters in the input.
