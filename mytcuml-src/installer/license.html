the systems, software, or data of TopCoder or any other party. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED
INFORMATION PROVIDED ON TOPCODER'S WEBSITES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES  You acknowledge
that the operation and availability of the communications systems used for
downloading the Software (e.g., computer networks and the Internet) can be
unpredictable and may, from time to time, interfere with or prevent access to the

interference with or prevention of your use of or access to the Software.  IN
NO EVENT SHALL TOPCODER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

<p class=MsoNormal>11.  The limitations of damages or liability set forth in
this Agreement are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between

<p class=MsoNormal>12.  INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  If
TopCoder becomes aware or reasonably believes that the Software licensed to you
under this Agreement may infringe the intellectual property rights of a third
party, TopCoder may at TopCoder’s discretion: (i) procure for you the right to
continue to use the Software, or (ii) modify or replace the Software to make
your use non-infringing while being capable of performing substantially the
same function;, or (iii) terminate this Agreement.  At the request of TopCoder,
you shall provide TopCoder with a list of all copies and locations of the Software,
including Software that have been merged with other software and/or source code. 
TopCoder may, from time to time, upon written notice to you, perform an audit
of your use of the Software and your compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.  The Software may include modifications developed by
people other than TopCoder.  If you have not received the Software directly

<p class=MsoNormal>14.  TopCoder shall have the right to immediately terminate
your access to or use of the Software in the event of any activities which are
in breach of this Agreement or conduct which, in TopCoder's judgment,
interferes with the operation or the use of the Software or the TopCoder web
site. Termination of this Agreement automatically terminates your license and
authorization to access the Software and any content or other material
contained therein. TopCoder is entitled to enforce its rights hereunder by an
action for damages or for specific performance, injunctive or other equitable
relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

of the Software.&nbsp; You represent and warrant that you have the right to grant
such permission, and that you are a duly authorized representative of your
company, and you are able to enter into and perform this Agreement.</p>

patent or other laws. The employees of TopCoder are not authorized to make
modifications to this Agreement, or to make any additional representations,
commitments, or warranties binding on TopCoder, except in writing signed by an

omitted and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Appendix A – Attribution Information</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Tahoma;
color:black'>As a modest attribution to TopCoder, in the hope that its
promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested by
TopCoder in the development of the Software, each time an application that
includes any portion of the Software in any way is operated (which includes
initiating a session), a prominent display of TopCoder’s Attribution Graphic
Image must occur at all times on the graphic user interface employed by the end
user to access such application of sufficient size to be clearly legible and
recognizable by the end user.  If the Software already displays such
attribution information in a particular form, continued use of such form for
that attribution is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.</span></p>
